We rejuvenate old computers by deleting the old operating system and replacing it with a Linux based operating system that is free, open-source and community-developed.

## Free

A Linux based OS can be downloaded free of charge onto a USB stick that you can then use to install on most computers. For example, Linux Mint (our flavour of choice) can be freely downloaded from [linuxmint.com](http://linuxmint.com)

## Open Source

Most Linux based operating systems are open source, i.e. the source code is made available for anyone to tweak or expand upon as they please. See this video to learn about open source software through a parable of an open source sandwich:

## Community-developed

Because it is open source, Linux generates a community of citizen developers who all help to contribute to its development. As such, it is owned by the community and not by a corporation.
