We rejuvenate old computers by deleting the old operating system and replacing it with a Linux based operating system that is free, open-source and community-developed.

## Free

A Linux based OS can be downloaded free of charge onto a USB stick that you can then use to install on most computers. For example, Linux Mint can be freely downloaded from [linuxmint.com](http://linuxmint.com){:target="_blank"}, and Google's Linux-based ChromeOS Flex can be freely downloaded from [their installation guide](https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11541904?hl=en){:target="_blank"}. Creating that OS-changing USB stick will seem complicated at first, but quite straightforward once you go through the motions (our favourite tool for this is [Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/){:target="_blank"}).

## Open Source

Most Linux based operating systems are open source, i.e. the source code is made available for anyone to tweak or expand upon as they please. See this video to learn about open source software through a parable of an open source sandwich (coming soon...).

## Community-developed

Because it is open source, Linux generates a community of citizen developers who all help to contribute to the development of its various flavours. As such, many Linux distributions are owned by a community and not by a multinational corporation.
