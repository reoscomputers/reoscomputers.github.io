# Make Your Old Laptop Great Again

Do you have an old slow laptop? Don't throw it out, don't recycle it, don't even refurbish it, ReOS it!

Did you know that you can rejuvenate slow old laptops simply by replacing the OS (operating system) with a free open source community-developed OS?

Seeing is believing, so take a look at videos of what these old ReOS-ed laptops can do:

2007 laptop running Apple TV Plus in 2024 (video coming soon...)

2009 laptop running YouTube in 2024 (video coming soon...)

2012 laptop running Google Drive in 2024 (video coming soon...)

Want to try it out? It's free! So give your old slow laptop a new lease of life by bringing it to the next ReOS Pop-up stall or booking an appointment.

*ReOS is a community non-profit initiative that is committed to prolonging the useful life of old computers*
