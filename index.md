# Make Your Old Laptop Great Again

![Lots of old laptops](/assets/img/2024/didilaptops.jpeg)

Do you have an old slow laptop? Don't throw it out, don't recycle it, don't even refurbish it, ReOS it!

You can rejuvenate slow old laptops simply by replacing the OS (operating system) with a free open source community-developed OS.

Seeing is believing, so take a look at videos of what these old ReOS-ed laptops can do:

Want to try it out? It's free! Why not give your old slow laptop a new lease of life, bring it to the next [ReOS Pop-up stall](https://www.facebook.com/repaircafebelmont/){:target="_blank"} or 
[book an appointment](https://calendly.com/splc-beconnected/digital-skills){:target="_blank"}.

*ReOS is a community non-profit initiative that is committed to prolonging the useful life of old computers*.
